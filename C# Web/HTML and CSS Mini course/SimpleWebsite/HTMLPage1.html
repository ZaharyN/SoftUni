                This is my second blog entry, and I just wanted to check in on you. I published my first article about business blogging
                in August, 2001. You can read it here. Whew. A lot of water under the bridge since then, including 9/11, which happened
                only a few weeks later.

                I'm so happy to write my first blog entry - yay! I published my first article about business blogging in August, 2001. You
                can read it here. Whew. A lot of water under the bridge since then, including 9/11, which happened only a few weeks later.
